We are not limited to attacking web applications and network services - we can attack hosts and systems.

This is especailly the case once we have gained an initial foothold and we are attacking other devices on the compromised networks.

These attacks often exploit misconfigurations and / or vulnerabilities in operating systems.

They are useful for when we find machines on internal networks which are not running network services apart from default ones such as smb.

In this section, we focus on *inherent* vulnerabilities in windows 🪟 and linux 🐧
